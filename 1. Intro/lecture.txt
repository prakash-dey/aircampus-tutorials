Javascript basics
->till now we have learned html for structuring of the content, CSS for styling the content. 
now we will learn Javascript for adding interactivity.
-> Don't worry, we are going to learn JS in deep but before that let us see some examples-
-> On user click the gun is moving right or left, scores are getting updated as game proceed.
-> we can drag the image gallery and select any image from the gallery
 -> we can do summation multiplication here.

These are some examples what we can build using javascipt,So cool right? but its not limited to these examples only.

from small action of clicking to complex animation and to write servers we use JavaScript.
-> Javascript is a programming language using which we add engaging and interactive features in our websites.


-> Browser uses two engines to render the webpage.
	layout engine renders the HTML and css files and JS engine renders the js files
-> We donot require any extra set up for running JS code, 
	to debug our JS code we can simply use JS developer tool called as console.

-> you can right click on any webpage and inspect to go to console
or short cut key for windows- ctrl+shift+J and for mac its cmd+option+J

->You are going to use JS console all throughout the course to run and test javascript code, identify and fix errors
as well as display messages from your program.

-> let us see some code now.
-> alert("Hi! want to see some cool thing?"), 
->prompt("Can you enter something"),
-> console.log("I am printing in console"), 
->clear() - clears the console 

-> let me just write a piece of code.
-> let myName = prompt("May I know your name?");
	alert(`Hi! ${myName}`);
-> We can enter our name and it returns the greeting. cool right?
-> Don't worry about the code right now, we will learn everything in our next modules to understand everything.
