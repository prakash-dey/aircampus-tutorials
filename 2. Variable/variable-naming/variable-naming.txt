In the last video we have learned to declare and access the values of a variable. But you cannot just
use any word for naming a variable. There are certain rules you will have to keep in mind.

let's see what are the rules and what happens if we do not obey them.

*Show example of each

// Can not use reserved words 
var var = 10; // not valid

// cannot contain spaces

// var my name =10;

// Variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($)

// We cannot start naming with number
// var 1m1y1N1ame =10; 

// We can use underscore
// var _myName =10; 


//  We cannot use special character
// var $myName@ =10;

// Snake case
// var variable_name;

// Camel case
// var variableName; 


Pro tips:

// Pro tips
// Use camel case only
// Try to name the variable meaningful, so that you do not need to pull your hair later figuring out what is the variable doing in your program.
