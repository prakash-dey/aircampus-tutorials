// And operator &&
// && is known as AND operator. It checks whether two operands are non-zero or not (0, false, undefined, null or "" are considered as zero). It returns 1 if they are non-zero; otherwise, returns 0.

// console.log((a != b) && (a < b));
// console.log((a != b) && (a > b));


// OR operator ||
// || is known as OR operator. It checks whether any one of the two operands is non-zero or not (0, false, undefined, null or "" is considered as zero). It returns 1 if any one of of them is non-zero; otherwise, returns 0.

// console.log((a > b) || (a == b));
// console.log((a < b) || (a == b));

// NOT operator !
// 	! is known as NOT operator. It reverses the boolean result of the operand (or condition). !false returns true, and !true returns false.

// console.log(!(a < b));
console.log(!(a > b));
