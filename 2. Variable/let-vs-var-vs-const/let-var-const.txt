We know how to declare a variable. right?
keyword variableName ;
we alredy know keywords are the reserved words in JavaScript, which has special meaning.

we have let, var and const as keyword to declare a variable.

Let's now dive deep on each keyword.

// var a=10;
    //  var a=50;
    //  no error in declaration;

    // let a=10;
    // let a=50;
    // error in declaration;

    // const a=10;
    //   a=50; // we cannot override the value
    //  const a;  //We cannot redeclare in same scope;
    //  no error in declaration;

// Let does not allow to redeclare the same variable in same scope
// Const does not allow to redeclare as well as re assign the variable
// If we use const we have to initialize the variable at the time of assignment.
// Javascript variables are weakly typed or dynamically typed language
